# Offline Fonts
Offline Fonts is a website designed to fetch and download fonts from a given URL. It parses CSS to find `@font-face` declarations, downloads the referenced font files, and rewrites the CSS to reference the local copies of the fonts. This can be particularly useful for web developers who want to ensure they have local copies of all fonts used in a project.
